# CSC365_Project
A program that uses a hastable, btree and graph algorithms that I coded from hand using books and other sources as a reference. The program scans and cashes text from a wiki page inside a hashtable, where the hashtables are then stored inside a btree. The program also uses a similarity matrix algrorthim that takes the hashtables from two websites and compares them. A multi path graph algorithm is then used to a determine the path of links and attempts to find the shortest route from the node that the user starts at. Need to note, this project was rushed for class and thus contains minor errors that may be fixed in the future when I have time. The current issues with the code is that the resize method for the hashtable needs a slight edit, Gui is unstable, and due to the way sites were added, the graphs may only extend up to two nodes as all urls that were obtained from the source (designated cluster head) which automatically links a head to an added url.
